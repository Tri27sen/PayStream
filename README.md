## 🔐 Authentication Flow

* Users authenticate using **magic email links**
* No passwords required
* Secure session handling using HTTP-only cookies
* Auth state protected server-side using `auth()`

---

## 🧾 Invoice Workflow

1. User logs in
2. User fills invoice form
3. Invoice data is validated with **Zod**
4. Invoice is saved to database
5. A **PDF invoice** is generated
6. PDF is emailed to the client
7. Invoice status is tracked (PAID / PENDING)

---


## 📤 Email + PDF Sending

* Invoices are generated as **PDF files**
* PDF is attached to email
* Sent using **Nodemailer**
* Mailtrap is used for development testing

---

## 🗄 Database Schema (Simplified)

* **User** – Authenticated users
* **Invoice** – Stores invoice details
* **Session** – User sessions
* **Account** – OAuth / email provider mapping
